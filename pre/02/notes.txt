In java there are many different types of data. These include double (can
contain decimals) int (integers), boolean (true vrs false) and more. When 
creating Java files and using parameters it's important to specify which type
of data is going to be imputed for the parameters. Also when defining a new
variable you must also state which data type it will contain. (Note: it is 
possible to switch between data types like double and int though it can lead
to error messages if done incorrectly)
