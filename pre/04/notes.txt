In this section we learned about conditionals, mainly if, else if, and else
statements. These conditionals can take in any data type, if using a variable
to test for equality use == like in python. You cannot have an else or else if
statement without an if statement prior. DO NOT FORGET SEMICOLONS, they are 
super important and go on any statement line that isnt the conditional.
