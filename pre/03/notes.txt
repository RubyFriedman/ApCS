Code for excercise 1 of chapter 4 above.

1. The output of the above program when main is invoked would be:
No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.

2. First prints out "No, I ". Invokes zoop which invokes baffle which adds "wug"
on to the string. ping is then invoked adding a period to the string.
A new line is created, and the code returns to zoops second line, "You wugga "
is added to the string of the next line. baffle is re-invoked which adds "wug"
ping is re-invoked adding a period to the string. zoop has now been fuffilled and
we return to main. "I " is added to a new line. baffle is invoked adding "wug" to 
the string, ping is invoked adding a period. The function is completed and the
final output is shown above.

3. If baffle is invoked at the end of ping, this creates a never ending loop 
between printing "wug" and "." because the functions continue to re-invoke one
another and there is no way to stop them.
