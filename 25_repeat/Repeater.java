HW25 -- Do I repeat myself?
2021-10-26
time spent: 00.5

DISCO:
 * Recursion is when you invoke the same method within itself
 * To use recursion you need a base case and a recursive reduction
   that eventually reaches the base case.
 * The java syntax for recursion is shockingly similiar to that
   for python.
 * If we plug in anything less than 1 in fenceR the code will
   break because it will never reach a base case.

QCC:
 * When should we choose to use recursion as opposed to a loop?
 * How do we avoid the error in discovery #4?
