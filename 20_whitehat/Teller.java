DISCO:
- The bank returned a number with 14 decimal places when we withdraw more
  than half the existing AccountBalance, even though only 2 decimal places
  were originally provided. This is a definite issue and vulnerability
  with the bank.
- If one were to use the deposit method to deposit negative money, (essentially
  withdrawing money using the deposit method) it’s possible to get a negative
  balance. This way of withdrawing money is able to escape the if statements
  in the withdraw method and take more money than there is in the bank account.
- A way to fix the vulnerability mentioned in the discovery above would be to
  add an if statement in the deposit function that only lets you deposit positive
  sums of money.
- All private variables are only accessible through BankAccount.java and not
  Teller.java.
- Public methods were executable in Teller.java, even though they used private
  variables.
QCC:
- Why is it that withdrawing a value over half the existing value or depositing
  a value greater than the existing value returns 14 decimal places when only 2
  are provided?
